Gallery Limb is a very effective WordPress image gallery plugin which allows you to make creative photo and video galleries with responsive layouts and customizable styles. The process of the photo and video gallery creation is very easy and enjoyable due to its high speed and the fact that the main actions of the gallery plugin, such as adding images and preview images to a gallery or an album are animated movements. Limb Gallery have 4 different views for gallery and 3 views for album.
